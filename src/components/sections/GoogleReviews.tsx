They were outstanding from start to finish. They reviewed opposing counsel\'s expert work and professionally dismantled it with precision and credibility. They updated their reports in real time when needed, responded thoroughly to the arbitrator\'s inquiries, and provided strong backup for every position they took. Our success was due in large part to having the Engels in our corner. I recommend them without hesitation.',

It might not always be the one you would hope to hear. But it is the one that is right and correct. Jason is careful, attentive to detail and thorough. He presents well at trial. And he is a pleasure to work with. He has my highest recommendation.',

Jason and his team did a fantastic job. He was extremely responsive and his report was exactly what we needed. I will use Jason again.',
