    title: 'How Forensic Accountants Uncover Critical Evidence with Operational and Underlying Business Records',
    description: 'Providing your forensic accountant with operational and underlying business records can be just as critical as providing financial statements, and in some matters it can reveal the key piece of evidence that shifts the direction of a case.',
    content: `
      <p>Providing your forensic accountant with operational and underlying business records can be just as critical as providing financial statements, and in some matters it can reveal the key piece of evidence that shifts the direction of a case. In complex litigation, the most persuasive evidence is often found in records that show the underlying operations of the business. By analyzing these records alongside the financials, forensic accountants can uncover proof of misconduct, identify transactional patterns and irregularities, and explain how an organization actually operated from the inside. In many cases, these records are the "needle in the haystack" that provides the factfinder with clear, persuasive evidence that financial statements alone cannot reveal.</p>

      <h2>Key Operational Records That Reveal Critical Evidence</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment litigation:</strong> Timesheets and payroll records can demonstrate whether employees consistently missed required breaks or did not receive overtime pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Construction litigation:</strong> Pay applications, continuation sheets, change orders, budgets, invoices, and schedules of values can demonstrate performance shortfalls, cost shifting, overbilling, and related-party transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Real estate litigation:</strong> Rent rolls, loan documents, lease agreements, property management records, invoices, and utility bills can uncover misappropriation of funds, diversion of rent revenues, and related-party transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual property litigation:</strong> Damages analyses are strengthened by examining product unit data, licensing reports, contracts, franchise agreements, and customer usage records.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculating damages:</strong> Website analytics, production schedules, inventory records, contracts, invoices, shipping documents, and payment processing data often don't just reveal sales activity but also capacity and demand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategic Advantage for Legal Counsel</h2>

      <p>For attorneys, the value of working with a forensic accountant lies in providing access to these operational and underlying business records so that no critical detail is overlooked. Supplying this information early in discovery not only helps identify irregularities and support or challenge allegations, but it also gives counsel a strategic advantage. The ability to connect operational and underlying business records back to the facts of the case can be the differentiator, allowing attorneys to present stronger arguments, anticipate opposing claims, and highlight the evidence that ultimately carries the most weight in court.</p>

    title: 'The Most Critical Action Steps for Preserving Evidence after an Embezzlement',
    description: 'Preserving accounting evidence after an embezzlement is crucial for pursuing the perpetrator of the fraud in civil and criminal courts.',
    content: `
      <p>Preserving accounting evidence after an embezzlement is crucial for pursuing the perpetrator of the fraud in civil and criminal courts. Forged checks, duplicate payments, fake expenses, hidden personal expenses, and inflated expenses are only a few of the countless ways an employee can embezzle from within an organization.</p>

      <h2>Immediate Action Steps</h2>

      <h3>1. Secure Access and Lock Out the Suspect</h3>
      <p>The first step to preserving evidence is to ensure that the suspect has been completely locked out of the organization's physical and digital records. The suspect should immediately be removed of access from the organization's physical devices, all accounting records including accounting software, banking access and records, credit cards, invoices, payroll, and internal document systems.</p>

      <h3>2. Preserve Accounting Records</h3>
      <p>If the suspect of the fraud had access to the organization's bank accounts and the organization's accounting records, the trail of evidence leading to the fraud may have been left within the organization's accounting records. To preserve this key evidence, it's essential to immediately make a complete copy of the organization's accounting records including the accounting software and general ledger exactly as the suspect left it.</p>

      <h3>3. Maintain Audit Trails</h3>
      <p>By making a copy of the organization's accounting software, the organization can also preserve the audit log within the accounting software. The audit log is a feature of the accounting software that tracks the creation, modification, and deletion of transactions. This allows the forensic investigator to identify who recorded the fraudulent entries, when they were recorded, and what the entries were.</p>

      <h2>Working with Forensic Experts</h2>

      <p>During the course of the fraud investigation, the investigator may identify falsified accounting entries and fraudulent journal entries that need to be corrected. By making a copy of the accounting software and general ledger, the organization can begin to correct their books while still preserving the fraudulent entries. This also allows the forensic accounting investigator to present the falsified entries, as well as the corrected entries, in court.</p>

      <p>It may also be necessary for the organization to retain the services of a digital forensics investigator to preserve the digital evidence associated with the embezzlement.</p>

      <p>As Certified Fraud Examiners, Engel & Engel has conducted hundreds of fraud investigations and testified as expert witnesses in numerous cases that have led to substantial fraud judgements.</p>

    title: '4 Key Documents Most Forensic Accounting Experts Need Before Discovery Closes',
    description: 'Whether your forensic accountant is retained to calculate economic damages, conduct a fraud investigation, or perform a business valuation, these four financial documents can almost always serve as the foundation.',
    content: `
      <p>Whether your forensic accountant is retained to calculate economic damages, conduct a fraud investigation, or perform a business valuation, these four financial documents can almost always serve as the foundation to assess the financial issues in any forensic accounting case. In some cases, these four financial documents may be everything your forensic accountant needs to prepare a sound financial analysis and testify in deposition or trial.</p>

      <h2>The Four Essential Documents</h2>

      <p>With these four documents, your forensic accountant will have the ability to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Assess the financial history and analyze trends of the entity through their financial statements.</li>
        <li>Investigate specific transactions and how they were recorded in the general ledger.</li>
        <li>Understand how the entity reported its financials under penalty of perjury to the IRS.</li>
        <li>Analyze the distributions taken out and the contributions put in by the owners of the entity.</li>
        <li>Verify specific transactions in the bank records and verify the accuracy of the financial statements.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Document Categories</h2>

      <h3>1. Financial Statements</h3>
      <p>Complete financial statements provide the foundation for understanding the entity's financial position and performance over time.</p>

      <h3>2. General Ledgers</h3>
      <p>Detailed general ledger records allow forensic accountants to trace individual transactions and identify irregularities.</p>

      <h3>3. Tax Returns</h3>
      <p>Tax returns show how the entity reported its financial information to the IRS under penalty of perjury.</p>

      <h3>4. Bank Statements</h3>
      <p>Bank statements provide independent verification of financial transactions and cash flows.</p>

      <h2>Case Applications</h2>

      <p>Since every case presents its own set of distinct issues, your expert may need to request additional financial and business records to conduct their analysis. While it's always best to retain your experts early, if you find yourself in a position where discovery is closing and you haven't spoken with your financial expert, requesting these four key financial documents may be just what your forensic accounting expert needs.</p>

      <p>Obtaining (1) Financial Statements (2) General Ledgers, (3) Tax Returns, and (4) Bank Statements will most likely be crucial to your forensic accounting expert in the following types of cases: Economic Damages, Fraud Investigation, Business Valuation, Bankruptcy & Insolvency, Intellectual Property (IP) Litigation, Real Estate Litigation, Construction Litigation, Alter Ego, Fraudulent Transfers, Employment Litigation, Business Interruption, Personal Injury, Accounting Malpractice, and Partnership / Shareholder Disputes.</p>
